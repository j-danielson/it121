            <h2>A Little Bit About Me</h2>
            <p>Growing up on a farm in "little town" Iowa, I moved to the big city, Seattle about 10 years ago. I am currently going through schoool for a web development and managing a bottle shop in West Seattle. My hobbies in my little free time is playing video games, playing with my Corgi Porkchop, and trying new beers!</p>
